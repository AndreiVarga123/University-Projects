# üíª Assignment 06 - 08
## Requirements
- You will solve one of the problems below using simple feature-driven development
- Your program must provide a menu-driven console-based user interface. Implementation details are up to you
- Implementation must employ layered architecture and classes

### For week 8 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 1 and 2
- Have at least 20 procedurally generated items in your application at startup
- Provide specification and tests for all non-UI classes and methods for the first functionality
- Implement and use your own exception classes.

### For week 9 (25% of grade)
- Implement features 3 and 4
- Implement **PyUnit test cases**

### For week 10 (50% of grade)
- All features must be implemented

## Bonus possibility (0.1p, deadline week 10)
- 95% unit test code coverage for all modules except the UI (use *PyCharm Professional*, the *[coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.3/)* or other modules)

## Bonus possibility (0.2p, deadline week 10)
- Implement a graphical user interface, in addition to the required menu-driven UI. Program can be started with either UI, without changing the source code.

## Problem Statements
### Activity Planner
The following information is stored in a personal activity planner:
- **Person**: `person_id`, `name`, `phone_number`
- **Activity**: `activity_id`, `person_id` - list, `date`, `time`, `description`

Create an application to:
1. Manage persons and activities. The user can add, remove, update, and list both persons and activities.
2. Add/remove activities. Each activity can be performed together with one or several other persons, who are already in the user‚Äôs planner. Activities must not overlap (user cannot have more than one activity at a given time).
3. Search for persons or activities. Persons can be searched for using name or phone number. Activities can be searched for using date/time or description. The search must work using case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
4. Create statistics:
    - Activities for a given date. List the activities for a given date, in the order of their start time.
    - Busiest days. This will provide the list of upcoming dates with activities, sorted in ascending order of the free time in that day (all intervals with no activities).
    - Activities with a given person. List all upcoming activities to which a given person will participate.
5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient implementation (no superfluous list copying).


# üíª Assignment 09
## Requirements
For the program you developed for Assignment 06-08 implement persistent storage for all entities using file-based repositories. Also implement a `settings.properties` file to configure your application. Observations:
1. You must implement two additional repository sets: one using text files for storage, and one using binary files (e.g. using object serialization with [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/pickle.html)).
2. The program must work the same way using in-memory repositories, text-file repositories and binary file repositories.
3. The decision of which repositories are employed, as well as the location of the repository input files will be made in the program‚Äôs `settings.properties` file. An example is below:

    a. `settings.properties` for loading from memory (input files are not required):
    ```
    repository = inmemory
    cars = ‚Äú‚Äù
    clients = ‚Äú‚Äù
    rentals = ‚Äú‚Äù
    ```
    b. `settings.properties` for loading from binary files, for someone who also created a GUI:
    ```
    repository = binaryfiles
    cars = ‚Äúcars.pickle‚Äù
    clients = ‚Äúclients.pickle‚Äù
    rentals = ‚Äúrentals.pickle‚Äù
    ui = ‚ÄúGUI‚Äù
    ```

**NB!** If your Assignment 06-08 uses layered architecture properly, these are the only places where source code needs to change:
1. *Repository layer* ‚Äì for implementing the required code.
2. *Application start module* ‚Äì to load the properties file and start the required repositories.

## Bonus possibility (0.1p, deadline week 12)
- In addition to the file-based implementations above, implement the repository layer to use JSON or XML files for storage (at your choice).
- Create a `Settings` class into which you load the data from the `settings.properties` file. Then, the application start module decides which modules are started by examining the `settings` object. This further decouples the properties input file from the application.

## Bonus possibility (0.1p, deadline week 12)
- Implement a database-backed (SQL or NoSQL) repository. Use the database system‚Äôs update functionalities properly (don‚Äôt rewrite the entire database at each operation).


# Assignment 10
## Requirements
Create a Python module that contains an iterable data structure, a sort method and a filter method, together with complete PyUnit unit tests (100% coverage). The module must be reusable in other projects. Update your code for Assignment6-9 to use the data structure (for storing objects in the repository) and both functions (in the repository or service layer) from this module.

## What you will need to do
- Implement an iterable data structure. Study the [`__setItem__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object),`__getitem__`, `__delItem__`, `__next__` and `__iter__` Python methods.
- Implement a sorting algorithm that was not/will not be studied during the lecture or seminar (no bubble sort, cocktail sort, merge sort, insert sort, quicksort). You can use one of shell sort, comb sort, bingo sort, gnome sort, or other sorting method. Prove that you understand the sorting method implemented. The sort function will accept two parameters: the list to be sorted as well as a comparison function used to determine the order between two elements.
- Implement a filter function that can be used to filter the elements from a list. The function will use 2 parameters: the list to be filtered, and an acceptance function that decided whether a given value passes the filter.
